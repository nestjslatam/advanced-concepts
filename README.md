# What we'll be doing in this Course

In this course we'll be working towards understanding more advanced and sometimes complex scenarios that come up when working with the NestJS framework.

## How the course is designed

In this course, each lesson is designed to be fairly independent from every other lesson - as we're going to be covering a lot of different (and unrelated) advanced topics with NestJS and the ecosystem.

You don't need to go in any specific order, as we'll usually make sure to finish up a topic (or clean up any code) before continuing onward.

ðŸ’¡ Note: that there are a few sections (schematics, DI sub trees, and Durable providers) where it will help to go in order for those lessons!

Also, it may be beneficial to keep each lesson (or section) in a separate Branch (for reference later on). When finishing a lesson, you can always revert back to your "main" branch, and create a new one - for the next lesson!
